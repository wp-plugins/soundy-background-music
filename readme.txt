A background music can be associated with all pages or all posts or with individual pages or posts.   
A Play/Pause button can also be displayed anywhere in the pages and posts.   
Defaults can be set in the settings page of the plugin.   
Individual post and page plugin settings can be configured in the Edit Page and Edit Post forms.   
In the plugin settings page, an audio track can be set per default, a play and pause button image can be uploaded and positioned anywhere.
